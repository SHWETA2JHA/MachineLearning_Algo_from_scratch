The K-nearest neighbor algorithm creates an imaginary boundary to classify the data. When new data points are added for prediction, the algorithm adds that point to 
the nearest of the boundary line. It follows the principle of “Birds of a feather flock together.” This algorithm can easily be implemented in the R language.

 K-NN Algorithm
1. Select K, the number of neighbors.
2. Calculate the Euclidean distance of the K number of neighbors.
3. Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.
4. Count the number of data points in each category among these K neighbors.
5. The new data point is assigned to the category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.
