Logistic regression is a statistical technique used for binary classification problems. It models the probability of an event occurring given a set of input features. 
The output of logistic regression is a probability value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the likelihood of the event occurring.

Logistic regression is widely used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and marketing, where binary classification is a common task. It can handle both 
numerical and categorical input features and is relatively easy to interpret compared to other classification models.

In logistic regression, the model is trained by optimizing a cost function using a technique called gradient descent. The cost function is typically the log-likelihood
of the training data, which measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual binary labels.
